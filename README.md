What did you observe about the life cycle when switching between screens or minimizing the app?
    -I noticed that switching between screens is more like functions callings by using ID. Behind the scenes, it calls the second screen by reading the onClick properties of the navigation button.

What did you learn about activity management in Android?
    -I learned that its process is similar to how Web development works like using event handlers (onClick) on a button. It basically respond to certain events when the button is pressed.
